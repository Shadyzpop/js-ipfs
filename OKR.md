# Quarterly Objectives and Key Results

We try to frame our ongoing work using a process based on quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Objectives reflect outcomes that are challenging, but realistic. Results are tangible and measurable.

## 2018 Q2

> Work in Progress

### The daemon is stable and so core is reliable

- `PX` - OWNER - The uncaught errors and memory usage are under control and a daemon can run for a week non stop.
- `PX` - VictorBjelkholm - One or more js-ipfs daemons are part of the IPFS infrastructure (Bootstraper nodes).
- `PX` - VictorBjelkholm - js.ipfs.io exposes an IPFS Gateway provided by a js-ipfs daemon.

### The core can handle vast amounts of data

- `PX` - achingbrain - The MFS is implemented in js-ipfs.
- `PX` - achingbrain - npm on IPFS is used as a test vector of js-ipfs capabilities.
- `PX` - hugomrdias - js-ipfs in the browser can fetch a dataset of at least 100Gb (and create archives.js.ipfs.io).
- `PX` - OWNER - js-ipfs in Node.js can add and transfer a dataset of at least 1TB.
- `PX` - jacobheun - A S3 IPFS Repo backend exists and it is easily pluggable on `new IPFS`.
- `PX` - JonKrone - The PIN API is finished and merged.
- `PX` - vasco-stantos - js-ipfs Service Worker gateway.

### The APIs are more ergonomic and developer productivity is off the charts

- `PX` - vmx - Complete the first milestone of the Awesome Endeavour - Flow.
- `PX` - vmx - Roadmap and Kickstart the second milestone for the Awesome Endeavour - Flow.
- `PX` - fsdiogo - Make js-ipfs uglify friendly again.
- `PX` - VictorBjelkholm - Every env (i.e Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge) test run is parallelized in CI.
- `PX` - VictorBjelkholm - CLI, HTTP-API and Core Tests of js-ipfs are parallelized in CI.
- `PX` - fsdiogo - A repo migration utility exists and migration is a good experience for js-ipfs users.
- `PX` - wraithgar - Achieve CLI and HTTP-API feature parity with go-ipfs for all the commands and endpoints planned (see https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/blob/master/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)
- `PX` - wraithgar - Bring code coverage up to 100% everywhere!
- `PX` - diasdavid - Every js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld and js-multiformats module has an assigned maintainer with clear responsibilities.

### libp2p levels up, learns new superpowers and a dedicated team is formed

- `PX` - hugomrdias - libp2p has primitives to keep connections under control.
- `PX` - dryajov - Readable Streams no more! Reduce the overhead of Readable -> Pull in libp2p-mplex.
- `PX` - diasdavid - The libp2p.next() refactor is complete.
- `PX` - diasdavid - Delegated Peer Routing and Content Routing modules are created.
- `PX` - diasdavid - Browsers no longer rely on static rendezvous points for Discovery.
- `PX` - jacobheun - js-libp2p gets its Private Networks implementation.
- `PX` - diasdavid - js-libp2p gets its own OKR spreadsheet for next Q3.
- `PX` - vasco-stantos - The name system (IPNS) works locally.
- `PX` - vasco-stantos - IPNS over PubSub.
- `PX` - vasco-stantos - IPNS over the DHT.
- `PX` - dryajov - NAT Traversal for the TCP Transport.

### The Community is pumped by having a selection of example applications, blog posts and video tutorials on how to build DApps with IPFS

- `PX` - OWNER - Blog post on PeerPad Architecture with focus on its Read/Write Capability System.
- `PX` - fsdiogo - The Exchange Files example gets a new face and becomes a fully usable app for exchange files (e.g files.js.ipfs.io).
- `PX` - Mr0grog - Identify the top 3 examples that would help the majority of the developers to understand how to use IPFS.
- `PX` - diasdavid - js.ipfs.io design gets finalized, implemented and published.
